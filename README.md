## Logistic Regression for LLMs Generated Text Detection:
Logistic Regression is a widely-used machine learning algorithm for binary classification tasks, including the detection of text generated by Language Models (LLMs). In this approach, features extracted from the generated text, such as word frequencies or n-gram occurrences, are fed into a logistic regression model. The model learns to distinguish between text generated by LLMs and authentic human-generated text based on these features. Logistic Regression offers simplicity, interpretability, and computational efficiency, making it suitable for detecting LLM-generated text in various applications such as content moderation, plagiarism detection, and fake news detection.

## LSTM for LLMs Generated Text Detection:
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known for their ability to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data, making them well-suited for text classification tasks. When applied to the detection of LLM-generated text, LSTM models learn to identify patterns and contextual cues indicative of language generated by LLMs. By training on a dataset containing both authentic and LLM-generated text samples, LSTM models can effectively differentiate between the two types of text. LSTM's inherent ability to capture sequential information allows it to discern subtle nuances in language usage, making it a powerful tool for detecting LLM-generated text across various domains, including cybersecurity, content moderation, and misinformation detection.
